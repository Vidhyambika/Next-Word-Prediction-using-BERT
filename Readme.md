# Next Word Prediction using BERT/GPT

The system supports next-word prediction through two approaches: GPT for sequential text generation and BERT for masked token prediction.
**Language used:** Python

## 🚀 Project Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) includes tasks like text classification, question answering, summarization, and next-word prediction. Next-word prediction estimates the most probable next word in a sequence based on the words already given. 

This project includes:
- A Python implementation using `transformers` (Hugging Face) and `torch`/TensorFlow.
- A final script (`final.py`) to run predictions.
- A report (`next word prediction using bert report.pdf`) explaining your approach and experimentation.
